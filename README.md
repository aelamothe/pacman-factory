# PacMan Factory Exercise
## Description of Project
Whatâ€™s better than one PacMan? Infinite PacMen! Create as many PacMen as you want and watch them bounce back and forth across the screen.

## How to Run
To view the webpage, please visit https://aelamothe.github.io/pacman-factory/. Click "Add PacMan" to generate a new PacMan on your screen. Click "Start Game" to have all of the PacMan begin to move. If you click "Start Game" again, the PacMen will move even more quickly.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
In the next iteration of this project, I plan to make the PacMan images flip upon hitting the screen, and have the mouths open and close. I'd also like to add balls that the PacMen chase across the screen to make a fun and playful visual.
